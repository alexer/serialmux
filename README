Introduction

Serialmux allows muxing one serial port between multiple programs.

Normally, when you point two programs at the same serial port, both will
more or less randomly get part of the data coming from the serial port.
With serialmux, when a second program opens the serial port, serialmux
disconnects the first program from the serial port and allows the second
program to use it. When the second program closes the serial port, it
connects the first program back to the serial port like nothing happened.

This is useful, among other things, when you have a serial port that can
be used both for logging/debugging and for programming a device. This is
true eg. on many ARM microcontrollers, such as on NXP's LPC series and
ST's STM32 series.

Without serialmux, you'd have to close minicom, program the device, and
open minicom again, possibly missing some vital debug output, requiring
you to manually reset the device. With serialmux, you can leave minicom
open, program the device, and you won't miss any output from the device.

I couldn't find a tool that would do this for me (but then again, I
never seem to...), so I created serialmux. And I really have no idea how
other people have been dealing with the same problem, given the lack of
this kind of tool; I assume the answer is that everyone else is just
using the JTAG/SWD interface to program their devices, but that's not
always feasible, so... yeah. serialmux.


Usage

sudo python serialmux.py /dev/ttyS0 ttyS0mux
(After that, use /dev/ttyS0mux instead of /dev/ttyS0 in other programs)


Requirements

cusepy (with all needed poll() -related functions)
- Get from: https://github.com/alexer/cusepy

ctypeslib (required by cusepy)
- PyPI page: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ctypeslib/
- (Previously) installed with: sudo easy_install ctypeslib==dev
- Last time I installed it, the above didn't work
- Install with: sudo pip install svn+http://svn.python.org/projects/ctypes/trunk/ctypeslib/

gccxml, libfuse, libattr1 (required by cusepy)
- If on Debian-based systems, install with: sudo apt-get install gccxml libfuse-dev libattr1-dev
